                        I worked on many Android projects, and used a huge variety of frameworks. I learned how to use the Cordova framework for embedding a web app into an Android app.
                        I used the Android Studio IDE, and I learned how to use the Android SDK. I used the Firebase platform for the backend management.
                        For another Android project I learned how to use the CameraX library for the camera management, and the MLKit library for recognizing objects in the real world through machine learning.
                        In the last Android project I learned how to use the ARCore library for enhancing our app with the newest Google augmented reality features.

                        On february 2023 I switched project and since then I am working as a fronted developer, using the Vue framework, for two Italian gaming platforms were we host mini games where people can play to earn money.

                        Meanwhile, I am working on a very important side project inside the company, which is the development of our metaverse, where many 3D and VR video-games are connected together thanks to a strong backend framework.
                        We are building this huge project with Unreal Engine 5 and in C++.
                        I am the tech leader of the development of the client side of our application, so I closely follow and guide all my colleagues through the 3D developments of our games but I specialize on developing the VR features of our games.
                        I really enjoy working as a game developer and I love virtual reality.
                        Lots of fun and learning have been done here, and I am very proud of my work.
                        Behold, as new things are coming!
